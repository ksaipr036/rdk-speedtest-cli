The client supports both download and upload tests:

Download test uses iperf3 with -R flag (reverse mode)
Upload test uses normal iperf3 client mode
Both use 4 parallel streams (-P 4) and 100M bandwidth limit (-b 100M)


For each test:

Runs iperf3 command
Reads output in real-time
Looks for [SUM] line with total bytes
Converts MBytes to bytes
Updates appropriate TR-181 parameters


To build and install:

bashCopygcc -o speedtest-client speedtest-client.c
sudo cp speedtest-client /usr/bin/
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/speedtest-client

To use:

bashCopyspeedtest-client <iperf3_server_ip>

Parameters updated:


For download:
CopyDevice.IP.Diagnostics.DownloadDiagnostics.TestBytesReceived
Device.IP.Diagnostics.DownloadDiagnostics.TotalBytesReceived

For upload:
CopyDevice.IP.Diagnostics.UploadDiagnostics.TotalBytesSent



Sample output parsing:

CopyInput: [SUM] 0.00-60.00 sec 674 MBytes 94.2 Mbits/sec receiver
Parsed: 674 MBytes â†’ 706,973,696 bytes
